 		<p>JavaScript is a programming language that fully supports web development. It gives developers the ability to create complex interfaces with ease. It is used all over the web. Thousands of technologies, frameworks, and tools have been built using JavaScript</p>

 		<h4>How is JavaScript Used?</h4>

 		<ul>
 			<li>It is used to make user interactive websites.</li>
 			<li>It is used to build apps and games.</li>
 			<li>It is used to organize and present data (data visualization, spreadsheets).</li>
 			<li>It is used to access information on the internet (think of trending topics on Twitter).</li>
 		</ul>

 		<h4>Advantages</h4>
		<p>JavaScript's biggest advantage is probably its speed. Because it is a client-side application, it doesn't need to contact a server and wait for a response in order to run. This also reduces the server load.</p>
		
		<p>Another advantage is JavaScript's simplicity. It is relatively easy to learn and implement. It uses a syntax that is similar to English.</p>
		
		<p>JavaScript is versatile. It works well with other languages, can be worked into any type of web page, and can be used in a variety of applications.</p>

 		<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
		<p>The biggest downfall of JavaScript is its lack of security. Because code is executed on a user's computer, people with less than honorable intentions can easily compromise it.</p>

 		<p>Another disadvantage is its unpredictability. It isn't always the same for all users. It can render differently depending on different browsers. This can negatively affect user experience on a website.</p>

 		<h4>So, Is It Relevant?</h4>

 		<p>Fans believe that JavaScript is poised to take over the programming world. JavaScript critics believe that it is sure to reach its demise in the not so distant future. Whatever your opinion is about JavaScript, you cannot ignore its popularity in the world of web development. It is an incredibly useful language with a myriad of applications for web developers of all types. After nearly 20 years, it is still quite relevant. </p>
