 		<p>I'd like to discuss stereotype threat. Maybe you've never heard this term before. In order to understand what stereotype threat is, I think it's important to first understand what social identity is. Social identity is the part of our personal identity, our sense of self and who we are, that stems from the social categories and group memberships to which we belong: age, race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, profession, social class, etc. Stereotype threat refers to being in a situation in which a negative stereotype about one of your social identities could be applied to you in that situation. It's that sense that you might be judged in terms of those negative stereotypes instead of on your personal merit. Decreased performance, use of self-defeating behaviors, disengagement, and altered professional identities and aspirations are just a few of the negative outcomes that can result from experiencing stereotype threat. Since most people have at least one social identity which is negatively stereotyped, most people are vulnerable to stereotype threat. Although, I believe that, unfortunately, some groups are faced with stereotype threat more often than others.</p>

 		<p>As a woman, I have felt stereotype threat more than once in my life. I recall the few years that I spent working in the construction field as a carpenter. It is not a very welcoming field for women. I was actually the only woman working with a crew of over thirty construction workers, ten hours a day, six days a week. I had done my training in a capentry apprenticeship program, where I was the only woman in my group of about twenty trainees. I had developed the same skills as my fellow apprentices. I knew how to get the job done and was willing to work hard. But, I constantly felt that I had to work even harder to prove that I belonged. I would go to work on a daily basis, prepared to learn and prepared to work. I was ignored by some of my fellow carpenters, especially the "old school" guys who didn't believe that women had any place at a construction site. There was that belief that women aren't strong enough or tough enough to deal with the physicality of construction work.  Every day that I went to work, I would take the initiative to begin the work alongside of the other carpenters, building concrete forms for the bridges that we were rebuilding. And, every day, I would be pulled from my place alongside of the guys and I was instead sent to work alone, beneath the bridge, cutting 2x4s and cleaning up. After a while, I dreaded the idea of going to work every morning. I started to believe that maybe I didn't belong there. Maybe I wasn't a good enough carpenter to work next to the seasoned veterans. I felt depressed and defeated. Why had I worked so hard to train as a carpenter? I didn't put in all of this work just to cut little blocks of wood and tidy up after everbody else. After four years, I left the construction field. I still do carpentry work, but it's mostly working on my own individual projects. No more glaring looks or insulting comments to contend with.</p>

 		<p>I've also felt stereotype threat not just as a woman but as a lesbian. Some people have very close-minded and absurd attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Like we are immoral. We are perverted sexual deviants. We are inappropriate role models for children and should be kept away from them because we may "teach" them to be gay like us. It's these types of negative stereotypes that lingered in my mind during my few years as a K-8 teacher. I was so afraid that parents might create an uproar if they knew that their child was being taught by a lesbian. I mean, I didn't hide my sexuality. My coworkers knew. But it wasn't something that I shared with parents or students. I found that I would distance myself more from some of the female students, fearing that people would believe that I was trying to "turn them into lesbians". Anyone who has worked with young children in a school setting, like those in kindergarten or first grade, know that they love to give hugs and get hugs from their peers and their teachers. I would make sure to keep myself away from those hugs as much as humanly possible. It made me very anxious. I didn't want to confirm any negative stereotypes about being gay. It was interesting to see that, in stark contrast to me, the straight female teachers that I worked with didn't distance themselves. They were happy to accept the hugs from their students, without fear or anxiety of being seen as inappropriate.</p>

 		<p>Unfortunately, stereotype threat exists in a variety of situations and environments, including, but not limited to, schools and the workplace. There are some strategies to reduce stereotype threat in such environments:</p>

 		<ul>
 			<li>reduce prejudice</li>
 			<li>convey that diversity is valued</li>
 			<li>increase the visibility and representation of people from minority groups in a field</li>
 			<li>foster better intergroup relations</li>
 			<li>exposure to successful role models from a social group who refute negative stereotypes of that group</li>
 			<li>personal value affirmations to reduce stress and threat (ex. write about and reflect on core personal values)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I think, that whether it be in a school or in the workplace, we need to be honest enough to admit that sterotypes do still exist. And as long as sterotypes exist, there will be stereotype threats existing as well. I wish I could say that I'll never experience sterotype threat again. But I don't think that is a realistic expectation. I think that having an open dialogue about my experiences can help me (or anyone else who may experience stereotype threat) better cope with the threat and reduce the negative effects of it.</p>
