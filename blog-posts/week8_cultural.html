 		<p>In life, there is conflict. It is inevitable. Disagreements, arguments, differences of opinions...we've all experienced our share. Often times, we respond to conflict by using one of four different defensive strategies.  These strategies are outlined in a concept known as 'The Compass of Shame'. Each direction on this compass represents four different coping mechanisms that we use when faced with conflict. To the North is Withdrawal; East is Attack Self; South is Avoidance; West is Attack Other.</p>

 		<p>I've given some thought as to how I react when I am faced with conflict and I've realized that I've used all four of these strategies at some point or another in order to cope. I would say that growing up, I didn't have a good model for dealing with conflict. Both of my parents are of the Avoidance type, denying that there is conflict at all. That sort of 'go about your day as if nothing has even happened' way of living. So I think that I learned to just pretend that there was no conflict or just avoid any situations where a conflict may arise. I have also, throughout the course of my life, used the Withdrawal and Attack Self strategies quite a bit. I would find myself running from the source of the conflict. I can recount many times where I would go off somewhere by myself and just brood. In these moments of isolataion, I often blamed myself. Surely there must be something wrong with me. I'm an awful person for letting this conflict occur. I felt like a failure. I think that all of those years of withdrawal and attacking self left me with a huge amount of unresolved anger and frustration.</p>

 		<p>In recent years, I have found that I have leaned toward the West point of the Compass, Attacking Others. By this, I do not mean that I have resorted to physical attacks or violence. I seem to do alot of 'turning the tables'. Let me explain. I have been with my wife for over 10 years. We have our moments of conflict, most definitely, as every couple does. Our arguments have often times turned into a tennis match. She serves and attempts to express her hurt feelings in regards to something that I have done. I hit the ball back to her and tell her how she has hurt my feelings. The ball goes back and forth over the net several times. I get caught up in this defensive pose. I don't want to hear how I have made her sad, so I try to put the blame onto her. She has done a, b, c and that's why I've done x, y, z. Nothing gets resolved this way. I end up feeling even more frustrated. Sometimes I feel like a balloon that's just been deflated. It's not a good feeling at all. I end up wishing I could just press pause and rewind back to the beginning of this whole match when my wife first confronted me. If that could happen, I would this time listen to what she has to say instead of preparing my defense.</p>

 		<p>With a lot of work and some expert help, I've learned some healthier ways to cope with conflict. It's still a work in progress. Life is a work in progress. I just keep working through it all.</p>
