 		<p><strong>Rdio</strong><br>
 			I love, love, love Rdio. It's a streaming music site where you can build up an immense collection of albums and songs. For a music fanatic like me, this site is pretty fantastic. One of the cool features of Rdio is the ability to browse by music in Heavy Rotation, Top Charts, New Releases and Recommendations. I particularly like the Recommendations feature. Rdio suggests music that I may like based on music that I already have in my collection. And speaking of my collection, I can add full albums or just a song or two from an album.<br> What I first notice when I visit this site are the images of the albums right there front and center. I get to see a bunch of cover art right away. And, in my opinion, the cover art is often one of the best features of any album.</p>
 		<p> This design of this site is simple and basic. It's heavy on the graphics, which I enjoy. It's bright and slick. Nothing fussy. Easily to navigate. It has both browse and search functions which making finding the music you want a breeze. Rdio has both free and pay plans. The main downfall of the free plan, for me, is that I have to listen to some ads every now and again. But I can live with that. If you love music and want to have tons of it at your fingertips, check out Rdio.</p>
 		<p><strong>Wayfair</strong><br> When I have some time to kill or I want some design inspiration, I visit Wayfair. They have a ton of stuff for the home. From furniture for every room in the hoom, to lighting, rugs, accessories, and decor, Wayfair has a large selection. The standout feature of Wayfair is the Daily Sales. These are items which are available for a short time at sale prices. I have to admit though, I have found alot of overpriced items on this site. But, I love to look and get inspired for my next home makeover session.</p>
 		<p>What usually gets my attention on the site are the photos of the Daily Sales and Top Picks. The design of the site is pretty simple and graphic. Soothing background colors draw me right in and make me want to shop. The bottom third or so of the home page is probably the least appealing to me. There's too much text. And it's pretty dull. The site is easy to navigate. You can search for something in the search bar, browse by room, or browse by category. I have yet to make any purchases but I have a long list of wants!</p>
 		<p><strong>IkeaHackers</strong><br>This is the site for repurposing Ikea products. If you don't know what Ikea is (is that even possible?), it's a home furnishings store. A very affordable home furnishings store. IkeaHackers is the place to go to learn how to make some really cool modifications to Ikea products and put your own stamp on it. Hacks can be found in many categories and are user submitted with detailed instructions including photos. I am a DIYer, so this site inspires me. It's yet another site that's clean and simple in its design and easy to navigate. The cartoon drawings on the home page are pretty cool too.</p>
