 		<p>How do I think? How do I process information? What strategies enhance my learning the most? What are my biggest obstacles when it comes to learning? These are all questions that have been cycling through my head ever since I embarked on my DBC journey. So I took the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz to help me answer these questions. I have to say that the results seem to be pretty much spot on. My thinking style can best be described as Concrete Random. I am most comfortable taking in information that I can see, hear, or touch and organizing that information in chunks. However, not every aspect of Concrete Random Thinking applies to me; nobody is purely one type of thinker. So what aspects do apply?</p>


 		<ul><strong>I work best when I:</strong>
 			<li>learn hands-on</li>
 			<li>can creatively solve problems</li>
 			<li>can experiment to find answers</li>
 			<li>can use trial and error</li>
 			<li>am self-directed (driven by what interests me)</li>
 			<li>am given the opportunity to work through problems by myself</li>
 		</ul>

 		<ul><strong>These are some of my challenges:</strong>
 			<li>routines</li>
 			<li>being told exactly what to do and how to do it</li>
 			<li>being told something can't be done</li>
 			<li>working within specific timeframes</li>
 			<li>completing projects</li>
 			<li>having to choose only one option</li>
 		</ul>

 		<p>How does any of this apply to my experience at DBC? I have found that my trial and error approach to problem solving is really helpful in coding exercises. Coding is definitely a process where you try one method, then maybe another, then another, and another...until you solve your problem. What I have struggled with so far is getting myself into a routine and trying to stay on task to finish all of the work in a timely manner. I've had to write out schedules for myself and stick to those schedules. I've completed all of my tasks so far, but I feel like I am often racing against the clock.</p>

 		<p>So can I expand and change the way that I think and learn? Can anyone? Absolutely! It's all about having a growth-mindset. It's about stepping out of your comfort zone every now and again and challenging yourself.   </p>
