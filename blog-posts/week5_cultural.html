 		<p>My stomach is in knots. Anxiety has come to visit me, unwelcomed. Do I really have to do this? Why am I so nervous? Ok, this won't be that bad. It's useful. I can benefit from this. This is part of the process. Join video chat. It's pairing time.</p>

 		<p>Yes, that was how I felt before my first pairing session. It's gotten easier since that first time but I will admit that I still get anxious. But that's me. I tend to get anxious in new situations when I'm learning new things and meeting new people. When pairing, you have to open up and share your ideas. You have to communicate and let your pairing partner know what you are thinking. When I am working on coding challenges, I tend to get inside my head and quietly think through the process. This method doesn't work so well when I'm pairing. I think that those moments of quiet contemplation can make my pairing partner think that I've just checked out of the challenge. Feedback that I've received confirms that.</p>

 		<p>And, since I've mentioned feedback...<br>I understand why it's so important. Not just at DBC, but in life. Receiving feedback can be a driving force in personal growth. You can choose to take the feedback and constructive criticism that you receive and learn from it. You can make the necessary adjustments to your thoughts and behaviors to help you become a more successful and enlightened individual. Or you can choose to ignore the feedback that you receive and remain unchanged, resistant to growth, all the while preventing yourself from reaching your greatest potential. I'll take growth, enlightenment, and success for 200 Alex.<br>I welcome the feedback that I receive. Giving feedback is more of a challenge for me. I have found that most of the feedback that I give is kind and specific, but not rated as highly actionable. </p>

 		<p>So what's the bottom line? Do I find pairing to be helpful?<br>Yes, I find it very helpful. I'm forced to work outside of my comfort zone and share my thought process. Every time I pair, it becomes easier for me to do that. What I find most beneficial about pairing is that I have the chance to learn how others approach the coding challenges. I've learned technical tips and tricks from my pairing partners that have simplified my code writing process. I enjoy the opportunity to bounce ideas back and forth and discover new ways to solve problems. Pairing provides a nice break from researching methods on Google and reading about them in books. I can actually talk to a real person and get clarification when I need it.<br>Do I enjoy pairing? I enjoy it more each time I do it. I'm still trying to get really comfortable with the process. I think that eventually, I might get to the point that it just becomes a routine part of how I work.</p>
