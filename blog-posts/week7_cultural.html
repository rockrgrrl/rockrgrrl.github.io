 		<p>Accomplishment<br>Achievement<br>Adventure<br>Challenge<br>Commitment<br>Creativity<br>Growth<br>Integrity<br>Personal Development<br>Truth</p>

 		<p>When reflecting on the values that are the most important and meaningful to me, these top my list. Now, I can't say that these have always topped my list. I'm sure my list looked much different twenty years ago. And that's to be expected. I'm a much different person today, thankfully. I'm not saying I was a bad person or anything like that. I just didn't really know who I was. I wasn't happy. I wasn't satisfied. I wasn't living the life that I wanted to live. I was living the life I thought I was supposed to live.</p>

 		<p>Things are much different for me today. I'm so happy. Happier than ever. I know who I am and who I want to be. I hold tight to each of my core values and try, every day, to live up to those values in all aspects of my life. Each of those values are interconnected. I live my life with truth. Truth about who I am and who I want to be, not who I think everyone else expects me to be. Truth in living my life openly as a lesbian, happily married to the love of my life. This truth connects with integrity. My belief in being honest and having principles. This integrity ties into my commitment. My commitment to my wife. My commitment to building a better life for us. My commitment to fighting for what is right, fighting for equality and justice. My commitment to social issues that are most important to me like women's rights, gay rights, animal rights. My commitment to pursuing my dreams and seeing those dreams become reality. In comes adventure. Taking a new and different path that's scary and exciting and rewarding all at once. With adventure, comes challenge. Challenging myself and daring myself to learn new things and explore new possibilities. When I challenge myself, creativity inevitably takes over. Creating new ways to solve problems. Developing new ideas. New ways of thinking. Creativity leads to personal development and growth. Becoming more enlightened. Discovering more about myself, my strengths, my weaknesses. This is where accomplishment and achievement step in. I feel like every time I try something new, I accomplish something. I acheieve a new goal. I elevate my self-confidence. This all leads to a better and happier me!</p>
