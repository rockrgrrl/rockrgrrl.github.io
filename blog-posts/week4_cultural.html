 		<p>We live a technology-driven society. We can't seem to put down our smartphones, tablets, and laptops. We can't seem to function without apps. We find new apps. And then we tweet about them. Because of that, tech jobs are booming. It's an exciting time to join the tech industry. But, the industry is not without its problems.</p>

 		<p>One of the biggest issues, and the most personal for me, is the underrepresentation of women in tech. According to the Labor Department, only twenty percent of software developers are women. Tech start-ups, which many people consider to be the most desirable places to work, employ even less women. That estimate is closer to twelve percent. </p>

 		<p>Computer science wasn't always dominated by men. The first computer program was written by a woman. Her name was Ada Lovelace. And she wrote that program back in 1842. Actually there is now an Ada Lovelace Day, which is an international celebration of women's achievements in science, technology, engineering, and math. Even in World War II, women did most of the programming for the ENIAC, the first electronic general purpose computer designed for the United States Army.</p>

 		<p>Unfortunately, it seems that once computer programming gained prestige, women were pushed out. Over the years, the number of women in computing has declined. According to the National Center for Women & Information Technology, in 2012, just 18 percent of computer-science college graduates were women, down from 37 percent in 1985.</p>

 		<p>So why should there be concern? Well, for one reason, more and more women are becoming consumers. They don't want to buy products that aren't applicable to them. Developers and engineers need to consider gender when creating new products. Hiring women would help bridge that gap between developer and consumer. Another reason for concern is that there are more jobs than available talent to fill those jobs. It's estimated that 
 		1.2 million computing jobs will be available in 2022. However, US colleges and universities are producing only 39 percent of graduates needed to fill them. Some of the biggest tech companies, like Google, are placing priority on recruiting women to increase the output of technology to the world. Yet, even at Google, less than twenty percent of the engineers are women. </p>

 		<p>How can we get more women in the tech field? I think first and foremost, the stereotypes need to be eliminated. Throw away those ideas of what computer programmers and developers should look like. Get rid of the notion that girls don't have the technical, scientific, or mathematical aptitude to pursue such careers. I also think that we need to encourage girls and women to explore tech careers by making this world more accessible to them. Non-profits, like Girl Develop It, are doing just that by offering programs to women who want to learn software development through mentorship and hands-on instruction. I also think that women-only hacker spaces are a great way for women to build up their tech skills and their confidence so that they can comfortably launch a tech career. It can, after all, be pretty daunting to enter a career where you are part of the minority. </p>

 		<p>I'm hoping that as I launch my career as a web developer, I will be along side other women doing the same. Things will change. I'd like to see at least a fifty fifty split of men and women in tech. I know it will happen. I just don't know when.</p>
