 			<p>You're coding and you've hit a stumbling block. You've got an error and you can't seem to fix it. You've done your research and still, nothing. It's time to hit the forums and ask the experts. There are a few key tips to keep in mind when asking questions. First, pay attention to your question title. The title is the first thing that readers will see while scrolling through a forum. Make sure your title is specific and descriptive. Try to summarize your question in one detailed sentence. In the body of your question, you'll want to expand upon your title. Again, details are important. Provide pertinent basics like language, operating system, software, etc. Explain the research that you've already done and the results of that research. If you've gotten specific error messages, include those too. Be specific as to your goal.What were you trying to accomplish when you encountered the error? It may be helpful to include some sample code. Make sure to use correct grammar, spelling, and formatting. This eliminates confusion and helps to communicate your question effectively. Before you submit your question, proof-read it! Pretend you are reading it for the first time. Does it make sense to you? If not, tweak it. Add any details that you may have missed. Clarify any details that may be confusing. After you post your question, be prepared to provide feedback to those who have answered it. If you keep this tips in mind, you should be able to get back to that code of yours in no time.</p>
