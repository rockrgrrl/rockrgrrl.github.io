 		<p>Ruby's Enumerable module provides a set of methods to search, sort, and transform collections.<br>I'm going to focus on the group_by method. This method does exactly what you might expect it to do. It splits a collection into groups based on given criteria. It can be used on arrays and hashes.<br>To use this method, you need a block with the criteria by which the items in the collection will be grouped. The result will be a hash. Eash hash key represents a group. Each key's corresponding value is an array holding the members of the group. Some examples might make things clearer.</p>

 		<p>When used on an array, group_by checks through (iterates through) the array and passes each element to the block. The resulting value of the block is the group in which the element belongs.</p>

 		<p>Here, each Brady child's name (represented by brady) is passed to the block . The block looks at the length of each brady name. The result is each group with the names that belong to it based on length.</p>

 		<p>In this example, the numbers 0 through 12 (represented by number) are passed to the block . The block looks at the remainder of each number when divided by 4. The resulting hash has four groups with keys 0 to 3. Key 1 Group holds numbers that when divided by 4 have remainder of 1. Key 2 Group holds numbers that when divided by 4 have remainder of 2. Key 3 Group holds numbers that when divided by 4 have remainder of 3. Key 0 Group holds numbers that are evenly divisible by 4 (remainder of 0).</p>

 		<p>When used as a hash, group_by passes each key/value pair to the block.</p>
