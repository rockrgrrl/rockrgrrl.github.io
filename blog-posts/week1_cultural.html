 		<p>What can I expect from the DBC experience? I can expect to have my mind blown. That's what DBC's founder Shereef says. Let me tell you, I am ready for a transformative, mind-blowing experience. This kind of environment, where we are told to get into creator mode rather than consumer mode, sounds really exciting. I love that it's described as a collective experiment where we will work cooperatively to learn from each other and teach each other at the same time.<br>Shereef brought up two fears that people seem to bring with them to DBC: the impostor syndrome, (I don't belong here, I don't know as much as everyone else) and the stuck in the land of mediocrity and boredom complex (I'm too good for this, I know this stuff, I'm bored). of the two, the impostor syndrome resonates with me. Before watching this video, I had that fear play over and over in my head. It calms me down to know that we are not all that far apart from each other in terms of knowledge and skills. Sometimes I do find it embarassing to proclaim my ignorance about a subject. Being vulnerable in that way is difficult. I am relieved to hear that creating a safe environment in which to expose those vulnerabilities is a priority at DBC.</p><p>I'm so excited to start this journey at DBC. At times, I'm also really nervous, scared, anxious, and stressed. But the excitement wins out. When I think about everything that I am going to learn. When I think about how this experience is going to impact my whole self, not just the aspiring developer part of me...well it thrills me and makes me optimistic about my future.</p>
