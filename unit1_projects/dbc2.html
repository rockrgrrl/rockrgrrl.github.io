  				<h3>What is a Vegetarian?</h3>
				 	<p>A vegetarian is someone who does not eat meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish, or the by-products of slaughter. In other words, a vegetarian does not eat animals. Instead, a vegetarian's diet consists of grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. The diet may or may not include dairy and eggs.</p>

  				<h3>Why go Veg?</h3>
					<p><strong>Compassion for animals.</strong>  Every year in the United states alone, more than 27 billion animals are slaughtered for food. Animals on factory farms are treated like nothing more than milk, egg, and meat machines. They spend their lives in cramped and crowded conditions, left to live in their own waste. Often times, animals are slaughtered while still completely conscious. Many are still alive when skinned, cut up, or defeathered. By switching to a vegetarian diet, you can save more than 100 animals a year. </p>
				
					<p><strong>Health.</strong>  Obesity, cancer, heart disease, and strokes have been directly linked to meat-based diets. People who eat meat are also at increased risk for diabetes, allergies, and food poisoning.</p>

					<p><strong>Environment.</strong>  Meat-based diets pollute our air and deplete our water supply. In the United States, more than half of the water used is for animal agriculture. At least 51 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture. Research has shown that switching to a vegan diet is more effective in reducing the effects of climate change than is driving a hybrid vehicle. </p>
